## Description

A simple incremental game made by me based on space.
This is simply a demo version as I have yet to implement a lot of features I want to.

P.S: There's nothing space-y about it except the names.

## Features
- Four types of resources
 * Stardust (starter resource)
 * Celestial Shards (resource gained through Cosmic Ascension)
 * Cosmic Energy (resource gained through Cosmic Ascension)
 * Stellar Fragments (resource gained through Stellar Rebirth)

* Two types of prestiges:
 * Stellar Rebirth: Resets Stardust and Buildings but doesn't reset Upgrades or Permanent Upgrades.
 * Cosmic Ascension: Resets everything except Permanent Upgrades.

* Over 25+ Buildings producing 2 types of resources.
* Over 20 Upgrades.
* Over 5 Permanent Upgrades

## Known Issues
* Game doesn't save when you close the game.
* The Upgrades tab grid doesn't properly snap back to its original position and zoom when buying an upgrade.
